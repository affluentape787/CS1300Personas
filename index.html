        <h1>Toaster Oven Personas and Storyboard</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center">I absolutely love eating warm bread and pastries. In this project, I explore a
            classic UX task with a toaster oven interface where I
            observe users interacting with a
            toaster oven, interview them about their experiences, form two personas, and sketch out a
            storyboard.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center"> I hope you enjoy!</p>
        <div class="I-container">
            <h2>I - Interface Sketch and Description</h2>
            <img class="big-image" src="./ToasterSketch.jpg" alt="toaster oven sketch">
            <p style="width: 75%">This toaster oven interface strives to address difficulties a user may encounter when
                customizing settings for their
                specific food-heating objective. The interface features a <b>large handle</b> to open the front glass
                cover
                and three separate <b>rotating
                    knobs</b> for temperature, mode (i.e. bake, toast, broil, or air fry), and time customization. It
                also
                includes <b>visual indicators</b> on
                the time knob so a user can set a specific burn level for their toast as well as a <b>bright orange
                    light indicator</b> at the bottom
                to show when the oven is on.</p>

            <h2>II - Key Observations of Three Users (A, B, and C)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Users A and B put the item into the oven and closed the door before looking at the knobs. User C
                    held their bread in their hand and adjusted the first two knobs before putting the bread in.</li>
                <li>When looking at the knobs, all users bent over so that they were at eye level with the
                    knobs. User C stared at the interface for a few seconds before actually touching the
                    knobs while the other users immediately started to move knobs.</li>
                <li> Users B and C had furrowed eyebrows and squinted as they looked at or used the knobs.</li>
                <li> User A only turned the bottom two knobs, disregarding the temperature knob, while the other two
                    users moved all three of the knobs in order from top to bottom.</li>
                <li> Only User C had the temperature knob turned to the toast preset even though all users were using
                    the oven to toast something.</li>
                <li> Once the timer started to tick, all the users would look and scroll or
                    type on their phone. User C peered through the glass one more time before pulling up something on
                    their phone. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>III - Prepared Interview Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What was your first reaction upon seeing the knobs on the toaster oven?</li>
                <li>What was the most difficult step to accomplish when using the toaster oven?</li>
                <li>Imagine you are living in your <b>ideal</b>, dream-world. What are some features that your toaster
                    oven would have?</li>
                <li>How many times have you used a toaster oven in the past seven days?</li>
                <li>What do you most frequently use a toaster oven for? </li>
            </ol>

        <div class=IV-container>
            <h2>IV - Takeaways from Interview Responses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All users were using the toaster oven to toast either a piece of bread or croissant, and most of
                    them were looking specifically for a 'toast' option when they first approached the toaster oven.
                </li>
                <li> For most users, the presence of three knobs coupled with many different settings and numbers in
                    small fonts was confusing.</li>
                <li>The two most common difficulties users had with the toaster oven were figuring out what temperature
                    to use and making sure the notches on the knobs aligned perfectly with the options they wanted.
                </li>
                <li> Some ideal toaster oven features mentioned by users included: precise control over temperature and
                    time, one-button presets for common toasting preferences, and a large screen that displays the
                    inside of the oven at any given time. <i>(Sidenote: I loved hearing about these cool features!)</i>
                </li>
                <li>All users use a toaster oven approximately 5-7 times a week.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>IV - Persona 1 - Hurried Hannah</h2>
            <img class="persona-image" src="./hurried_hannah.png" alt="Hurried Hannah Persona">
            <p class="caption"><u>Description:</u> Hurried Hannah is a full-time employee at a big firm who rushes to
                the
                office every morning
                but wants to
                fit in a quick breakfast before work. She despises having to figure out a bunch of complex buttons or
                knobs on a toaster oven.
                Hurried Hannah represents how two of the users I observed started to turn the knobs without ever pausing
                to examine them first and how one user did not even bother to adjust temperature. Additionally, all
                users occupied themselves with something on their phone almost immediately after the toaster
                oven timer started, indicating that they had other tasks to attend
                to.Â

            <img class="persona-image" src="./met_michael.png" alt="Meticulous Michael Persona">
            <p class="caption"><u>Description:</u> Meticulous Michael is a full-time pre-med student who eats an
                identical
                breakfast every
                morning and is
                very particular about his food. He does not like how he has to eye the temperature and time using the
                knobs on the toaster oven and wishes he had access to more precise temperature and time increments.
                Meticulous Michael reflects how some users were more careful when preparing to toast. One user stared at the knobs for a couple seconds before adjusting the settings. Two of the users also
                squinted their eyes and furrowed their eyebrows as if focused on analyzing the knobs. One user also
                double checked the knobs and glanced inside the toaster oven before parting from the toaster.

            <h2>VI - Storyboard - Meticulous Michael</h2>
            <p>I am no artist, but I hope this rudimentary storyboard helps demonstrate how a person like Meticulous
                Michael would use the toaster oven from beginning to end. </p>

        <h3 font="Segoe UI" style="text-align: center"> Thanks for going on this journey with me! I had a lot of fun
            learning about how people use toaster ovens and about the different steps in the process of creating
            personas
            and storyboards. I hope you also learned a thing or two about this process, but if not, I hope you got a
            good laugh from my drawings!</h3>
